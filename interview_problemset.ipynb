    "The game starts by picking one player to play first. These players will play each trick as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The selected player plays a random card from their hand. This is the **starter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Every following player plays a card from their hand. This card **must be the same suit as the starter**. You can choose any valid card in this step. **Do not worry about player strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If a player does not have any cards in their hand of the same suit as the starter, **they may play any card**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print out each player and the card that they played, using the message \"Player {X} played {Card}\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The winner is the player who played the card with the highest rank card that is also the **same suit as the starter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Print the name of the winner. The **winner of this trick is now the starting player** for the next trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This is repeated until all of the players have no cards in their hands, then the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this part of the problem, simulate an entire game.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be 13 rounds total in the game."

    "## Summary\n",

    "We've implemented three approaches to find shortest distances in a tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Approach**: Find shortest distance between two individual nodes\n",
    "   - Uses BFS from one node to another\n",
    "   - Time: O(V + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Set Approach**: Find shortest distance between two sets\n",
    "   - Checks all pairs (x, y) where x ∈ a, y ∈ b\n",
    "   - Time: O(|a| × |b| × (V + E))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimized Multi-Source BFS**: Efficient version for large sets\n",
    "   - Starts BFS from all nodes in set 'a' simultaneously\n",
    "   - Stops when any node in set 'b' is reached\n",
    "   - Time: O((|a| + |b|) × (V + E))\n",
    "   \n",
    "**When to use each:**\n",
    "- Use the basic approach for single node-to-node queries\n",
    "- Use naive approach when sets are small (|a| × |b| < 10)\n",
    "- Use optimized approach for larger sets or repeated queries"
