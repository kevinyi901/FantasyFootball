    "We've implemented three approaches to find shortest distances in a tree:\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Uses BFS from one node to another\n",
    "   - Time: O(V + E)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Set Approach**: Find shortest distance between two sets\n",
    "   - Checks all pairs (x, y) where x ∈ a, y ∈ b\n",
    "   - Time: O(|a| × |b| × (V + E))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimized Multi-Source BFS**: Efficient version for large sets\n",
    "   - Starts BFS from all nodes in set 'a' simultaneously\n",
    "   - Stops when any node in set 'b' is reached\n",
    "   - Time: O((|a| + |b|) × (V + E))\n",
    "   \n",
    "**When to use each:**\n",
    "- Use the basic approach for single node-to-node queries\n",
    "- Use naive approach when sets are small (|a| × |b| < 10)\n",
