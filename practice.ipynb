    "The game starts by picking one player to play first. These players will play each trick as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The selected player plays a random card from their hand. This is the **starter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Every following player plays a card from their hand. This card **must be the same suit as the starter**. You can choose any valid card in this step. **Do not worry about player strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If a player does not have any cards in their hand of the same suit as the starter, **they may play any card**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print out each player and the card that they played, using the message \"Player {X} played {Card}\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The winner is the player who played the card with the highest rank card that is also the **same suit as the starter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Print the name of the winner. The **winner of this trick is now the starting player** for the next trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. This is repeated until all of the players have no cards in their hands, then the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this part of the problem, simulate an entire game.**\n",
